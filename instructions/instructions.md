# Prompt for Integrating Eliza AI into the STARKLA Platform

**Objective:**  
Research and document the technical requirements, capabilities, and implementation strategy for integrating Eliza AI into the STARKLA platform with a focus on enhancing educational features and supporting language learning.

**Task Requirements:**

1. **Technical Analysis:**
   - **API Review:**  
     Examine Eliza AI's API endpoints, response formats, and documentation. Detail how authentication is handled (e.g., API keys, OAuth) and document any rate limits and usage quotas.  
   - **Security & Performance:**  
     Analyze authentication flows, data structure formats, performance considerations, and error handling strategies. Consider any state management needs for maintaining conversational context.

2. **Integration Planning:**
   - **Data Exchange & State Management:**  
     Identify integration points with STARKLA:  
       - User interaction flows (how students engage with language learning features).  
       - The data exchange formats required between Eliza AI and STARKLA.  
       - State management requirements for tracking dialogue context and user progress.
   - **Architecture Documentation:**  
     Create a system diagram and describe data flows. Map the API endpoints and outline the authentication and error handling flows.

3. **Feature Evaluation & Implementation Strategy:**
   - **Language Learning Capabilities:**  
     Research and assess Eliza AI's functionality in supporting language learning. Address:  
       - Conversation capabilities for practical language practice.  
       - Grammar checking and pronunciation assessment features.  
       - Vocabulary enhancement and progress tracking mechanisms.
   - **Feature Implementation Guide:**  
     Document the necessary endpoints, expected data structures, state management approaches, error handling strategies, and testing approaches. Define measurable success metrics.
   - **Fallback & Scalability:**  
     Include strategies for handling rate limits, potential API downtime, fallback mechanisms, and scalability considerations, including comparing with alternative AI APIs like OpenAI or DeepSeek if relevant.

4. **Deliverables:**
   - **Integration Architecture Document:**  
     System diagram, detailed data flow descriptions, API endpoint mappings, and authentication flow.
   - **Feature Implementation Guide:**  
     List of required endpoints, data structures, error handling strategies, and state management approaches.
   - **Technical Requirements Document:**  
     Documentation on API key management, rate limiting considerations, performance benchmarks, and security requirements.

**Additional Guidelines:**
- Review similar AI integration projects to adopt best practices.
- Consider user privacy implications and fallback strategies.
- Evaluate the suitability of alternative AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek) based on scalability and performance.
- Ensure definitions, diagrams, and code samples (if needed) are clear and concise.

**Outcome:**  
Produce a comprehensive documentation package that includes the integration architecture, feature implementation guide, and technical requirements. This package will serve as the blueprint for incorporating Eliza AI into STARKLA to deliver enhanced educational and language learning capabilities.
